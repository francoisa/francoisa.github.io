        <h1>Notes from Andre Francois</h1>
        <h2>Reducing the Windows Partition</h2>

        <p>The first thing that we need to do is reduce the size of the existing Windows partition. Window's Disk Management tool 
            is the most efficient method for accomplishing this task. The Disk Management tool can be accessed by using Win+r 
            and entering the command diskmgmt.msc.</p>
        
        <p>Right-click on the Windows 7 volume (C:) and selected “Shrink Volume.” Then enter the amount of space (in Megabytes) 
            that the partition should shrink (which in turn becomes the amount of space available to install our Linux distribution), 
            which in our example is 48000 Megabytes (48 Gigabytes), then select “Shrink” (See Figure 1). 
            When complete, exit out of the Disk Management tool and reboot the system.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Configure Windows for Dual Boot</h2>
        <pre>dd if=/dev/sda3 of=/mnt/share/ubuntu.bin bs=512 count=1</pre>
        
        <p>Exit out of the Ubuntu live system and reboot to Windows 7. Along the way, you may see Windows perform a disk check 
            (don’t worry, that’s normal, and should only occur once as a result of these procedures). Log into Windows 7 and 
            open the FAT32 volume you created and you should see the ubuntu.bin file. Copy that file to the root of the Windows 7 
            volume (e.g., C:).</p>

        <h2>Use BCDEdit to add an entry to Windows Boot Manager</h2>
        
        <p>Administrative privileges are required to use BCDEdit, so use Win+r, type cmd, and then press CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER. 
            Let’s start by creating an entry for our Linux distribution. Note here that you are free to choose another 
            entry name if desired:</p>

        <pre>bcdedit /create /d “Ubuntu” /application bootsector</pre>

        <p>BCDEdit will return an alphanumeric identifier for this entry that I will refer to as {ID} in the remaining steps. 
            You’ll need to replace {ID} by the actual returned identifier. An example of {ID} is 
            {d7294d4e-9837-11de-99ac-f3f3a79e3e93}. Next, let’s specify which partition hosts a copy of the linux.bin file:</p>


        <pre>bcdedit /set {ID} device partition=c:</pre>

        <p>The path to our ubuntu.bin file: </p>

        <pre>bcdedit /set {ID}  path \ubuntu.bin</pre>

        <p>An entry to the displayed menu at boot time:</p>

        <pre>bcdedit /displayorder {ID} /addlast</pre>

        <p>and finally, let’s specify how long the menu choices will be displayed:</p>

        <pre>bcdedit /timeout 30</pre>

        <p>That’s it! Now reboot and you will be presented with menu where you can choose to boot to Windows 7 or Ubuntu. 
            When you choose Ubuntu, you’ll be taken to the it bootloader menu where you can choose to continue booting Ubuntu.</p>

        <p>On a final note, if at any time you want to eliminate the Ubuntu menu option simply delete the BCD store entry 
            you created using the following command:</p>

        <pre>bcdedit /delete {ID}</pre>
        
        <h2>List Drives and Partitions</h2>
        
        <pre>sudo lsblk -o NAME,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT,LABEL</pre>
